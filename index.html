        <p>Hi, I am Jinru! And welcome to my portfolio. I am a full stack web developer, namely, one of those code monkeys trying to build a website out of nowhere. I have been in the startup world for a few years and I love the enthusiasm and flexibility they offer. I am a native of China living in Beijing as of Feburary 2017, and cities I have lived in the past include San Francisco, New York City and Shanghai.</p>
        <p><b>*Update: I will be in New York City for ~1 month(until late May) for job hunting, so don't hesitate to hit me up for a cup of coffee if you have anything interesting.</b></p>

        <h1>Code</h1>
        <p>Programming languages I'm actively using include <b>Python</b>(both for <i>web development</i> and <i>data processing</i>) and <b>JavaScript</b>(React.js). In the past I had also worked with <b>Ruby</b>(very extensively, mostly with Ruby on Rails but also with other Ruby frameworks) and <b>Elixir</b>(mostly with Phoenix for API development). The next language I plan to dive into is Go.<p>
