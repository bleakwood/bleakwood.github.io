        Hi, I am Jinru! And welcome to my portfolio. I am a full stack web developer, namely, one of those code monkeys trying to build a website out of nowhere. I have been in the startup world for a few years and I love the enthusiasm and flexibility they offer. I am a native of China living in Beijing as of November 2015, and cities I have lived in the past include New York City and Shanghai.

        <h1>Code</h1>
        I mostly code in Ruby and Javascript/Coffeescript. I have experience building a variety of web applications, also knowledge with front-back ends communication, web services and API design.
        <p>I started using Ruby on Rails in 2011 to build websites and have not been able to imagine leaving it ever since. I have also tried using different Javascript frameworks for JS-heavy client side pages, Backbone.js and Angular.js are two most prominent ones.</p>
        <p>I have also played many other roles for a shorter time in my career, iOS Developer, project manager, PHP developer and of course the devops guy. Those roles helped me significantly in understanding which part of the application development process do I enjoy most.</p>
